## ⚙️ Vercel Configuration

Your project includes a `vercel.json` file with optimal settings:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "flutter build web --release",
  "outputDirectory": "build/web",
  "framework": null,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables (If Needed)

If your app requires environment variables:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add your variables:
   - `FLUTTER_WEB_USE_SKIA=true` (for better performance)
   - Any API keys or configuration

## 📱 Post-Deployment Testing

After deployment, test these features:
- ✅ Responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails**:
   ```bash
